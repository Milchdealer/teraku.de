      <description>Prices of german houses So for a while I had a scraper running, which, once a day, scraped housing prices from chosen regions in Germany. I accumulated about 6 month of data until I stopped it, mainly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I&amp;rsquo;d ever properly utilise it.
I decided to at least show some of it. This post is basically excerpts from a Jupyter notebook. A link to the data can be found at the end.</description>
